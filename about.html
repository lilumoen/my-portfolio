    <p class="about-me-text">
      As a recent graduated junior front-end developer, I am excited to embark
      on my journey in the tech industry. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS,
      API Integration and JavaScript, I have honed my skills through various
      projects and coursework during my studies. I have a keen eye for design
      and user experience, which drives my passion for creating interactive and
      visually appealing web applications. Having completed collaborative
      projects, I have gained practical experience working with popular
      front-end frameworks such as React, Bootstrap and moment.js.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />I am comfortable using version control systems like Git, and enjoy
      working in agile environments where teamwork and communication are key.
      Eager to learn and grow, I stay updated with the latest trends and
      technologies in web development. I am particularly interested in
      responsive design and accessibility, ensuring that my projects are usable
      for a diverse audience. My goal is to contribute effectively to a dynamic
      team, continually improving my skills while delivering high-quality web
      solutions that meet user needs. With my fresh perspective and dedication
      to building great user experiences, I am ready to take on challenges and
      make a meaningful impact in the world of front-end development.
